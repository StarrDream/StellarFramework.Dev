# StellarFramework

A modular C# framework for Unity projects. This repository contains the runnable Tank Arena case study and the Kit export project. Run the sample, then select the capabilities your project needs in Tools Hub.

Release: **{{RELEASE_VERSION}}**

Dev source commit: [{{SOURCE_COMMIT}}](https://github.com/StarrDream/StellarFramework.Dev/commit/{{SOURCE_COMMIT}})

## Framework overview

Open the repository in Unity Hub and wait for imports to finish. Run Tank Arena, or select individual Kits, Profiles, and resource backends from **StellarFramework → Export** to create a unitypackage. Import it into your Unity project and install any UPM dependencies listed in the package manifest.

Sample scene: `Assets/StellarFramework/Samples/TankArena/Scene/FrameworkDemo.unity`. Scripts, prefabs, and art assets are included in the Sample. See the [Tank Arena case study](Assets/StellarFramework/Samples/TankArena/CaseStudy.md) for gameplay and Kit integration.

## Requirements

- Unity Editor 2022.3.62f3c1
- Unity Package Manager access on first open to resolve `Packages/manifest.json`
- Unity Editor is required to run the sample or export Kits, not to read the documentation

## Framework concepts

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime | Framework foundation; add Kits as needed |
| Kit | A focused capability such as ResKit, UIKit, or LocalizationKit |
| Adapter / Provider | Connects a Kit to a backend; loading, content updates, and code updates are selectable independently |
| Profile | An exportable selection of Kits and adapters; use individually or combine |
| Tools Hub | Editor setup, build, diagnostics, and export tools; not part of the game Player |

ResKit provides the shared resource entry point. Resources, AssetBundle, Addressables (AA), and YooAsset are optional loading backends. The YooAsset content update Provider manages resource content; the HybridCLR code update Provider manages hot-update assemblies.

## Architecture

`StellarFramework.cs` defines the MSV foundation. `Architecture<T>` registers Models and Services and manages initialization, lookup, and disposal. A View reads Models through the read-only architecture interface and sends interactions to a Service. Services perform application operations and access Models. BindableKit can be added for state notifications.

## Kit guide

Choose Kits by task. Tools Hub exports an individual Kit, a Profile, or a combination of resource backends.
